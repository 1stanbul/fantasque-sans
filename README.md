                       Cosmic Sans Neue Mono
                       =====================

                       
A programming font, designed with functionality in mind, and with some 
wibbly-wobbly handwriting-like fuzziness that makes it unassumingly cool.

Not related to other Cosmic Sans from the Internet. This one has Neue at the 
end, and it changes everything (most notably the coolness level). The name 
comes from my realization that at some point it looked like the mutant child of 
Comic Sans and Helvetica Neue. Hopefully it is not the case any more.

Inspirational sources include Inconsolata and Monaco. I have also been using 
Consolas a lot in my programing life, so it may have some points in common.


Weights, variants and glyph coverage
------------------------------------

The font includes a bold version, with the same metrics as the regular one. 
Note however that I have not tested much the bold version yet, so it might look 
bad in some cases. Both versions include some accented glyphs, but this font 
does not have any kind of exhaustive coverage now.

It lacks a good italic version, which I plan to design later, in a fashion 
similar to Consolas' italic version, with new glyph designs, not just an added 
slant.
